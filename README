Libslds stands for Library for Storage and Lookup Data Structures.

It started from the observation that no library exists in C that is really portable and that embeds common algorithms for data structure manipulation.

The libslds was built (and is still building!) with the insight of keeping things as simple as possible and to keep the library focused on algorithms.
Therefore, memory allocation calls are prohibited from the library as well as any other calls related to a library or another. Just because the conviction
is that algorithms do not need it and that it is a good way to keep things simple.

In order to achieve a good quality level, the library is completely unit tested. Any functionality has its own tests battery. Any bug is first reproduced
through a test and then fixed.
 
The only thing the library needs by now is motivated developers to improve it!
