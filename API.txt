	** note on the API of libslds **

Basic principle:
The library relies on two principles:
    - no memory allocation. Everything is provided by the caller and the API focuses only on the algorithm.
    - class agregation like behaviour. Data structures can be easly added to a container simply by addind a
      variable member to it.
